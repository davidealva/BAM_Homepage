## The Why & How

This is a concept for a new homepage for the Boise Art Museum, what you are seeing is a quick
concept I was asked to design and code in a few hours and deliver a working prototype.

The before and current site can be found at:

### What was wrong?

If you visit the current site for Boise Art Museum you see several technical flaws
the main issue, the site doesn't respond well and is buggy in mobile and tablet size
views. Aside from that I felt that for a museum it lacked visual appeal, a museum displays
art, things that a beautiful and or captivating. I felt that the current site lacked pop,
visual appeal. Secondly, being a non-profit organization, membership and raising money is
crucial but yet the current site didn't seem to give good visual cue's as to where and how one could donate or find a way to dig deeper. Lastly, the museum has a calendar of events and
classes, as well as other constant engagements with the community. The information was not
presented in intuitively or in places on the homepage that would be easy to find with a quick
visual scan.

### My thinking and design

After doing a competitive analysis of other museums, similar type galleries, as well as
getting a feel from the current site what was important, I developed my idea.

My thinking was that for a museum, it need more visual pop, and boldness. Keeping the red
accents and and font gave the white space some boldness yet retaining the "breathing room"
without feeling cluttered. I opted for a large bold slider to dominate the space above the
fold to draw you in with the interesting visuals and information for current and upcoming
showings.

Beneath the slider you are immediately given what they felt was most pertinent information,
How to join/donate, what is coming up this week, and hours of operation. The next most dominant
and lacking from their current design was a feed on the homepage to visually scan "News" and "Events", as well as place to draw visual attention to upcoming artists showings.

I approached this from a mobile first approach ensuring the most important information as the
design collapses to accommodate different device sizes. Overall the design shows what I can accomplish in a short amount of time, and with a few iterations I'm able to provide functional,
visually interesting design. I would expect under normal circumstances to continue to fine tune,
using analytics, user profiling, and validating my design assumptions with the usual tools and testing to validate the direction of my work.
